Exercise 8.2

A)
	i)  It is composable because it is made of different components and different layers of components. The components are then rendered by react and this is helpful/important because it allows us to reuse code between components and keeps a clear structure.
	ii) JSX is like a middle step that will add XML syntax to JavaScript.
	iii) Comments are created when the user enters one in and the submit is triggered which then sends an ajax POST of type JSON and data comment to the server. Then when the comment is loaded there is another ajax request of type JSON, which then calls setState to include the data.
	iv) Props are immutable and they are passed from the parent and "owned" by the parent. Mutable means we can implement interactions and state is mutable. 

B)
	i)  The changes will automatically load due to the 2 second rule which is calling the AJAX statement.
	ii) It doesn't call render because that should come at the end when all composite components have been defined and render can then return a tree of React components.
	iii) We want it to always represent the current state because we want the state of the view to be the same as that of the component. It makes it more clear. Components should always represent the state of the view.
	iv) It adds speed which is nice and if the server does deny it then we will know pretty quickly and it will change. However, if the server accepts it then it was there that much faster.
